Final Answer: As a local expert in Delhi, I can recommend some of the best hiking spots in and around Delhi that are suitable for visiting from May 1 to 5. Considering the weather during this time, which is usually hot and dry, it's essential to choose trails with shade and water sources.

One of the most popular hiking spots near Delhi is the Aravalli Range, which offers several trails for different skill levels. The hills are about an hour's drive from Delhi, and the trails offer scenic views of the surrounding landscape. Another great option is the Sanjay Van trail, a 7-kilometer hike through a forested area with plenty of shade and wildlife spotting opportunities.

For those looking for more challenging hikes, the Dhauj trek in the Aravalli Range is an excellent choice. The trek takes you through dense forests, hills, and scenic valleys, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. 

It's worth noting that May can be a hot month in Delhi, with temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) or more during the day. Therefore, it's essential to take necessary precautions such as carrying plenty of water, wearing sunscreen, and hiking early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun is not too strong.

Additionally, considering the traveler is coming from Kochi, which has a more humid climate, they should be prepared for the dry heat in Delhi. Staying hydrated, taking breaks in shaded areas, and avoiding strenuous activities during peak sun hours will help them acclimate to the local conditions.

Overall, with proper planning and precautions, hiking in and around Delhi can be a fantastic experience, offering stunning natural beauty and a chance to connect with nature.
